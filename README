TrabBD v 0.2
Important note: text requisites will be maintained on Google Docs

What's already done:
 - Database interface
 - Template XHTML/CSS that will be the base for all pages (at least for now) 

What's half way:
 - Page class: I still have to test it with real content
 - Menu class: Just begun it

What we haven't started yet (lots of stuff):
 - Photos module
 - Videos module
 - Gallery module
 - Layout module
 - User Management Module

What would be cool but's not so important
 - Page edit interface
 - Menu edit interface
